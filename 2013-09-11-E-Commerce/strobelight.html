<p class="p_format">Shine a bit of light into a dark space with this portable strobe light from Lava Lite. The tough plastic construction protects the specially designed bulb and lens that provides a blinking strobe light when switched on. The cord is long enough to allow for mounting onto a wall, with the adjustable handle able to direct the light to wherever you need. Good for party lighting, theatrical use, or whenever you just want to experience the slow-motion effect possible with a strobe light.
